Planning

Create classes to represent all of the shapes
  with attributes of l/w/h/r
  methods of calculating SA/volume
  for example class sphere

Create objects 
  representing an instance of each of the shapes

Implementing other aspects of oop
  inheritance? - potentially have subclasses of different types of shapes
      (pyramids, rectangular prism vs square)
  polymorphism?
  encapsulation?
