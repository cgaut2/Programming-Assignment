Planning
  create 1 class to dtermine variables and shapes
  with attributes of l/w/h/r
  methods of calculating SA/volume
  create a second class to call the methods

Create objects 
  representing an instance of each of the shapes

Implementing other aspects of oop
  inheritance? - Use subclass to hold methods; volume and surface area
  polymorphism?
  encapsulation?
