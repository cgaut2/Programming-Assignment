Algorithms

Main class

Create variables
  radius,sideA,sideB,sideC,sideD
get input from user asking what shape
use if/case statements to determine which object to create
  get input for sidelengths based on which object is being created
  call the appropriate calculation method 
  output the result
    


Class calculations
create method "Surface Area Rectangular Prism"
2 × w × l + 2 × l × h + 2 × h × w
create method "Volume Rectangular Prism"
 l × w × h
create method "Surface Area sphere"
4 × π × r²
create method "Volume sphere"
(4/3) × π × r³
create method "Surface Area cone"
π × r² + π × r × √(r²+h²)
create method "Volume cone"
π × r² × (h/3)
create method "Surface Area cylinder"
2 × π × r × (r + h)
create method "Volume cylinder"
π × r² × h
